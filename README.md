Description: The program is a game in a 2D grid represented by a matrix similar to the Puzzle Bobble game (also known as Bust-a-Move). The game has 5 random pieces, which will appear one at a time at a fixed point in the middle of the base of the board, and after the player's action, this must go to the indicated place. The possible final place that the piece will be must be visible for the player to take action to shoot it, and this path must also be controlled by the player. The player aims to get as many points as possible before the end of the game, which ends when the pieces reach the base of the board. As the playing time goes by, it becomes more difficult, so that the line belonging to the top of the playable board will “go down” little by little.
